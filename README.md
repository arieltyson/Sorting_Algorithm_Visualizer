## Project Description 🗺️

This project demonstrates Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms through the use of Python and Pygame. An intuitive way to visualize and understand the mechanics of these sorting algorithms!

## Project Set-up & Configuration  💻

### Prerequisites 📋

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pygame library (Installable using pip)

## Skills Demonstrated 🖌️

This project provides a thorough depiction of the combination of User Interface best practices and Python to create an educational tool. The sorting algorithms visualized include Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort.

- **Array**: This component corresponds to the data that the user visualizes. It represents the data that is being sorted by the chosen algorithm.

- **Visualizer**: The Visualizer component is used for all the UI logic of the application. It generates a user interface for the user. Visualizations are created by the data which is manipulated by the sorting algorithm.

- **Sorting Algorithms**: The sorting algorithms are the components that enable the sorting of the array. They don't have to worry about handling UI logic, they just tell the array what to do. They process all the sorting logic and manipulate data using the Array component, and interact with the Visualizer to render the final output.
